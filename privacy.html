        <h2 id="m2427">Relevant Legal Bases</h2>
        <p><strong>Relevant legal bases under the GDPR:</strong> Below is an overview of the legal bases of the GDPR on
            which we process personal data. Please note that in addition to the provisions of the GDPR, national data
            protection regulations may apply in your or our country of residence or domicile. Furthermore, specific
            legal
            bases may be applicable in individual cases, which we will inform you about in the data protection
            declaration.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Performance of a Contract and Pre-Contractual Inquiries (Art. 6(1)(b) GDPR):</strong> Processing
                is
                necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is a party or for the
                implementation
                of pre-contractual measures requested by the data subject.</li>
            <li><strong>Legitimate Interests (Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR):</strong> Processing is necessary to protect the
                legitimate
                interests of the controller or a third party, provided that the interests or fundamental rights and
                freedoms
                of the data subject do not outweigh the interests of the controller.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>National Data Protection Regulations in Germany:</strong> In addition to the data protection
            regulations
            of the GDPR, national data protection regulations apply in Germany. This includes, in particular, the
            Federal
            Data Protection Act (Bundesdatenschutzgesetz â€“ BDSG). The BDSG contains special provisions on the right to
            information, the right to deletion, the right to object, the processing of special categories of personal
            data,
            processing for other purposes, and the transfer as well as automated decision-making in individual cases,
            including profiling. Furthermore, data protection laws of the individual German states may apply.</p>
        <p><strong>Reference to the Applicability of the GDPR and Swiss Data Protection Act (DSG):</strong> These data
            protection notices are intended to inform you about the processing of personal data in accordance with the
            Swiss
            Federal Data Protection Act (DSG) and the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). For this reason, please
            note that, due to the wider geographical scope and comprehensibility, the terms of the GDPR are used. In
            particular, instead of the terms "processing" of "personal data," "predominant interest" and "particularly
            sensitive personal data" used in the Swiss DSG, the terms "processing" of "personal data," "legitimate
            interest," and "special categories of data" as used in the GDPR are used. However, the legal meaning of the
            terms is determined in accordance with the Swiss DSG within the scope of the applicability of the Swiss DSG.
        </p>

        <h2 id="m27">Security Measures</h2>
        <p>We implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of protection appropriate to
            the
            risk, taking into account the state of the art, implementation costs, the nature, scope, context, and
            purposes
            of processing, as well as the probability and severity of the risk to the rights and freedoms of natural
            persons.</p>
        <p>These measures include, in particular, safeguarding the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data
            by
            controlling physical and electronic access to data, as well as the access, input, transmission, securing the
            availability, and separation of data. Furthermore, we have established procedures to ensure the exercise of
            data
            subjects' rights, the deletion of data, and the response to data threats. We also take data protection into
            account when developing or selecting hardware, software, and procedures, in accordance with the principle of
            data protection by design and data protection-friendly default settings.</p>
        <p>TLS/SSL Encryption (https): To protect the data of users transmitted via our online services, we use TLS/SSL
            encryption. Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) is the standard technology for securing Internet connections by
            encrypting data transmitted between a website or app and a browser (or between two servers). Transport Layer
            Security (TLS) is an updated and more secure version of SSL. Hyper Text Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS) is
            displayed in the URL when a website is secured by an SSL/TLS certificate.</p>

        <h2 id="m24">International Data Transfers</h2>
        <p>Data Processing in Third Countries: If we process data in a third country (i.e., outside the European Union
            (EU)
            or the European Economic Area (EEA)) or if the processing occurs in the context of using third-party
            services or
            disclosing or transferring data to other persons, entities, or companies, this only occurs in compliance
            with
            legal requirements. Subject to express consent or contractual or legal requirements, we process or have
            processed the data only in third countries with a recognized level of data protection, which includes US
            processors certified under the "Data Privacy Framework" (DPF) as of July 10, 2023. This framework,
            established
            by the European Commission, also
